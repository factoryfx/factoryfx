# Support multiple instances

## Summary

Add support to run multiple instances (multiple server)

## Motivation

Currently, factory updates can only be send to one instance. Other instances are not notified about the update.


## Description



## Risks and Assumptions

* This feature can be seen as a recommendation to run FactoryFX in multi instance environment. This is not the purpose of a DI framework.
